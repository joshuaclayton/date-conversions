# Date Conversions

This is a Haskell library for handling date operations easily, e.g. calculating
the beginning or end of a week, month, quarter, or year.

```haskell
import qualified Data.Time as T
import qualified Data.Time.Calendar.DateConversions as DC

-- Given the following signatures
--
-- now :: T.UTCTime

DC.beginningOfWeek $ T.utctDay now
DC.beginningOfMonth $ T.utctDay now
DC.endOfYear $ T.utctDay now
```
